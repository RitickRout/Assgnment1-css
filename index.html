    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how Html element are to be displayed on screen,papper, or in other media </li>
        <li> <b><del>CSS is not necessary</del> <span style="background-color: yellow;"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Css can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements  </li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external Cssfiles.However,<b > <span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span></b> because this is easier too demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class  applies a style to multiple elements, Id, on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique element , ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript 
      <br> <br>  In CSS ,selectors are used to target a specific element on web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles or set of styles can be applied to the element <br> <br> There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID . Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. <br>
